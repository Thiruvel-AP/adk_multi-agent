Finalized Flow for the Agent (MVP version): 
    Connect the socket to start the interactions. 
        Wait 2 seconds, or the agents start the conversation like a general friend with warm gesture. 
        Once the user starts, go with the usual flow as discussed. 
        Get the user's voice
        Process it 
        If there is a normal conversation, try to talk with the user with the friend agent. 
        If there is a task specified by the user
            Process the input and get the actual context
            With the context, Plan and prepare the task (sequence or parallel (decide the number of agents required for the task with the function calling)) 
            Proceed with the task with the task doing agents (max 3 to 5) 
            Bake the output
            Make it as the voice back and send the output.
